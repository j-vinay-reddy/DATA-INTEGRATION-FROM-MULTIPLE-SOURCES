# DATA-INTEGRATION-FROM-MULTIPLE-SOURCES

üìä Sales Executive Dashboard ‚Äì Power BI Project
üîç Project Overview
This project is a Sales Executive Dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI, which provides an interactive and comprehensive overview of a company‚Äôs sales performance across multiple dimensions including time, geography, product, and sales teams. The goal of this dashboard is to empower decision-makers with real-time insights into key sales metrics, enabling better forecasting, performance tracking, and data-driven decision-making.

The dashboard integrates multiple visualizations and KPIs to allow users to filter and drill down into sales data by product, country, sales manager, and date range.

üìÅ Data Sources
This dashboard was created by integrating simulated data from two distinct sources (for internship task simulation):

Excel File: Sales_Data.xlsx ‚Äì Contains transactional sales data including product, region, sales manager, date, quantity, and revenue.

CSV File: Employee_Info.csv ‚Äì Includes employee details like name, department, region, and performance rating.

This satisfies the "Data Integration from Multiple Sources" requirement, as per the internship instructions.

üìà Key Metrics Displayed
At the top of the dashboard, six high-level KPIs provide an immediate snapshot of performance:

# Transactions: Total number of individual sales transactions (20,258).

Quantity Sold: Total units sold across all products (369,343).

Sales (Mn): Total revenue generated, displayed in millions ($196.41M).

Average Basket Value: Average transaction size ($9,695.59).

Total Profit (Mn): Total profit in millions ($53.31M).

Profit Percentage: Overall profit margin (27.14%).

These KPIs are dynamically updated based on slicers selected by the user (product, sales manager, country, and date range).

üìä Visualizations & Insights
1. Transactions by Date
A time-series column chart shows the daily volume of transactions over multiple years (2019 to 2022). This allows for:

Identifying seasonality in sales

Detecting sudden spikes or dips

Understanding long-term growth trends

2. Transactions by Product
A colorful donut chart visualizes the distribution of transactions across different products. This reveals:

Top-performing and underperforming products

Balanced or skewed product sales mix

Opportunities for focused product promotion

3. Transactions by Sales Manager
This bar chart breaks down the transaction count by individual sales managers (e.g., John Smith, Jane Doe, etc.). This is useful for:

Evaluating team performance

Identifying top performers

Recognizing training or support needs

4. Transactions by Country
A filled world map marks the geographic distribution of transactions, with bubbles indicating intensity by region. It helps:

Visualize global presence

Compare sales by continent or country

Highlight strong and weak markets

üîß Interactive Features
Slicers for filtering by:

Product

Sales Manager

Country

Date Range

These slicers allow users to focus on specific dimensions and dynamically update all visuals and KPIs across the dashboard.

üí° Insights Gained
The company maintains a steady volume of transactions with seasonal peaks.

Product C, A, and E have nearly equal distribution, indicating a healthy product portfolio.

John Smith is the leading sales manager in terms of transaction volume.

North America is a primary market, but other regions could be further explored.

Profit margins (27.14%) suggest room for improvement in pricing, cost, or product mix strategies.

üìå Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard project demonstrates an effective integration of multiple data sources and conversion of raw sales data into actionable business insights. It satisfies internship requirements such as data integration, dashboarding, and dynamic filtering.

This solution not only visualizes sales KPIs but also empowers users to interact with and explore data for data-driven decision-making.
